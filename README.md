# Let`go to intern

## Overview
This repository serves as a structured index for my programming laboratory works completed during:

- **1st and 2nd Semesters (Fundamentals-of-algorithmization-and-programming - C++)**  
- **2nd Semester (Programming C#)**  
- **T-Bank Education Program: Algorithms and Data Structures Course**
- **Course work on Golang coming soon**

## Coding Standards

- **C++**: Follows [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
- **C#**: Follows [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
- **Algorithms**: Written with a focus on clarity, performance (Big-O optimizations), and modularity.

All projects are built and tested locally before submission.

## Future Work

- Expand the repository with additional project work (microservices, database systems).
- Public examples will be created in parallel for open-source contributions.
